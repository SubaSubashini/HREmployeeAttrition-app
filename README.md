<h1>Employee Attrition Prediction using Machine & Deep Learning</h1>

<h3>📘 Overview</h3>

This project focuses on predicting Employee Attrition — whether an employee will leave the organization or stay — using Machine Learning and Deep Learning techniques.
Employee attrition is a critical HR problem that affects productivity, recruitment costs, and organizational growth.
By leveraging data analytics and predictive modeling, this project aims to help HR teams make data-driven retention decisions.


🎯 Objective

The primary goal of this project is to:

Predict employee attrition based on various factors (age, job role, satisfaction, etc.)

Identify key drivers influencing attrition.

Provide actionable insights to reduce employee turnover.

⚙️ Project Workflow

1. Data Collection – Import and explore HR dataset.


2. Data Cleaning – Handle missing values and outliers.


3. Data Preprocessing – Encode categorical variables, scale numerical features.


4. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) – Analyze patterns using visualizations.


5. Model Training – Apply ML and DL algorithms to train the predictive model.


6. Model Evaluation – Evaluate accuracy and performance metrics.


7. Feature Importance – Identify top factors influencing attrition.


8. Model Deployment (Optional) – Deploy model via Streamlit or Flask app.
